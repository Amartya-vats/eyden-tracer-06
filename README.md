## Problem 1
### Shearing Transform (Points 10 + 10)
Now the framework includes the **Tranform.h** file which contains the ```CTransform``` class. This class implements most of the affine transormations discussed at the lectures (when studying the class please pay extra attention to the rotation transoform). The main goal of this class is to deliver the transformation matrix with ```CTransform::get()```. Within this problem we will implement shear transform. Proceed as follows:
1. **Implement the shearing transform**
   * Fork the current repository
   * Modify the README.md file in your fork and put your name above
   * Study the ```CTransform``` class. It is written in respect to a design pattern, called [Fluent Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface)
   * Implement ```CTransform::shear()```method (_e.g._ in between ```translate``` and ```rotate```methods)
   * Achieve the resulting transformation matrix using the ```Mat CTransform::get()``` method

2. **Apply the shearing transform**
   * Study the new methods and member - variables in the ```CSolid``` class, namely the concept of the _pivot point_ and how it is used in the ```CSolid::transform(const Mat& t)``` method.
   * In order to apply transformation matrix to a solid use the ```CSolid::transform(const Mat& t)``` method. This method calls ```virtual void ÃŒPrim::transform(const Mat& t) = 0;``` wich should be implemented in all the derived classes.
   * Implement method ```void CPrimTriangle::transform(const Mat& t)``` in **PrimTriangle.h** file. Here you need to apply the transformation matrix to the vertices as well as to the normal of the triangle. You can use static methods ```static Vec3f CTransform::point(const Vec3f& p, const Mat& t)``` and ```static Vec3f CTransform::vector(const Vec3f& v, const Mat& t)```
   * Test your implementation on one of the solid spheres in the scene

## Problem 2
### Target Camera (Points 10 + 10)
So far we have used mostly the perspective cameras, which were defined as cameras' position, direction and field of view (fov). A camera defined like that is also called _free camera_. For many cases (_e.g._ for animation) it is more convinient to operate a _target camera_ instead. A target camera instead of the _direction_ vector has a _target_ point, _i.e._ the point of space where the camera looks at; thus it is defined with two points - position and direction (and same fov). The goal of the first problem is to prepare our camera for animation. Proceed as follows:
1. **Prepare the ```CCameraPerspective``` class for animation**
    * In ```CCameraPerspective``` class implement the following accessors: 
        * ```virtual void setPosition(const Vec3f& pos);```
        * ```Vec3f getPosition(void) const;```
        * ```virtual void setDirection(const Vec3f& dir);```
        * ```Vec3f getDirection(void) const;```
        * ```virtual void setAngle(float angle);```
        * ```float getAngle(void) const;```
   
   These methods will allow us to modify the camera after it was created and added to the scene.
2. **Implement the ```CCameraTarget``` class**
    * In the **CameraTarget.h** file implement the ```CCameraTarget``` class. It should be derived from the ```CCameraPerspective``` class and tt's constructor should have the following form: ```CCameraTarget(Size resolution, const Vec3f& pos, const Vec3f& target, const Vec3f& up, float angle)```, _i.e._ take parameter _target_ instead of parameter _pos_. Implement the above mentioned logic of target amera directly in initialization in constructor.
    * In ```CCameraTarget``` class implement the following accessors: 
        * ```virtual void setPosition(const Vec3f& pos) override;```
        * ```virtual void setTarget(const Vec3f& target);```
        * ```Vec3f getTarget(void) const;```
        
In **main.cpp** file substitute your free perspective camera with the target camera and test your implementation.
